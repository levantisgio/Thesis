This thesis focuses on the use of modern ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) technologies and version control systems for managing and processing cybersecurity data. It provides an analysis of the three core stages of the ETL process—data extraction, transformation, and loading—along with the integration of version control tools like Git and GitHub to support collaboration and ensure data integrity. Additionally, the study explores the application of STIX/TAXII standards for secure threat information sharing and the use of Power BI for data visualization. The thesis highlights the importance of automation and workflow optimization to enhance the efficiency of data management and support strategic decision-making.
